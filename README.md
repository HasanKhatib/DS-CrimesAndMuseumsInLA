# Data Science Correlation Experiment - Correlation between LA Crimes and Museum Visitors
This repository contains an experiment in which I tested the correlation between the Crimes number in LA and the number of Museum Visitors in the same city.

## Experiment Datasource
In this experiment I used two datasets from open-access repositories in order to get the information needed for my experiment. Those data sets were:
1. LA_Crime_Data_from_2010_to_Present.csv
2. LA_museum_visitors.csv
Both input and generated data were preserved on Zenodo using this DOI citation: [10.5282/dmp.LAexperiment.data](https://doi.org/10.5282/dmp.LAexperiment.data)

## Prerequisites
This experiment was performed using JavaSE 11.0 with Apache Spark 2.4 "It's a Maven project, so don't worry about versions". Other libraries were used and will be listed in Prerequisites section.
